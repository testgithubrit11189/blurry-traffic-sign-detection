# Traffic Sign Recognition with Deep Learning

This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- Loads and preprocesses GTSRB dataset from Pickle format.
- Converts RGB images to grayscale for efficiency.
- Visualizes training, validation, and test datasets.
- Trains a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Handles noisy and blurry images with normalization and augmentation.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was provided in `.p` (Pickle) format:
- `train.p`
- `valid.p`
- `test.p`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Pickle

## 🧪 Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Load dataset files (`train.p`, `valid.p`, `test.p`).
4. Run the Jupyter notebook
